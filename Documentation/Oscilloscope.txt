Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Start -This method starts continuous conversion on all channels that are set in the component inspector. When each 
                measurement on all channels has finished the <OnEnd > event may be invoked. This method is not available if the 
                <interrupt service> is disabled and the device doesn't support the continuous mode. Note: If time of 
                measurement is too short and the instruction clock is too slow then the conversion complete interrupt and its 
                handler may cause a system overflow.
   - AD1_Stop -This method stops the continuous measurement or disables a trigger mode (if supported by HW), which has been 
                started by one of the following methods:  [ Version specific information for Freescale ColdFireV1, HCS08, HC08 
                and RS08 derivatives ]     - <Start>     - <EnableIntChanTrigger>    - <EnableExtChanTrigger> The Stop method 
                is available if one of the previously mentioned methods is supported by A/D converter device and is enabled to 
                be generated.
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "AS1"       (component AsynchroSerial)
   - AS1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S08QE128_80)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
